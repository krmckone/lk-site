## Welcome to my site.

I'm Kaleb McKone and I'm a software engineer. This site is home to my posts, where I talk about various topics, and renderings that I have produced as I learn computer graphics. This is a really slow process but I'm consistently trying trying to put more and more time into it.

Click around and see what you find. Check out the [about](about.html) page to find out more about how this site works.
