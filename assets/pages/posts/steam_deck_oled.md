# Steam Deck OLED

I first received my Steam Deck LCD 256GB in July of 2022. I had been waiting for about 4 or 5 months at this point after putting five dollars down to reserve one.

This was probably the coolest device I had ever owned. Most of my steam games available on a handheld changed the whole game for me. In addition, it was just a little linux machine that even made it easy to get to the regular linux desktop. The track pads were an improvement over the steam controller's, the back paddles added additional function while letting you keep your thumbs on the track pads or sticks, and the screen was honestly good enough.

There were some drawbacks, though. Not every single game available on steam would work out of the box. Games with native linux support generally work great. Proton enabled tons of windows-built games to also run just fine on steam deck. However, some games did have software limitations that prevented them from running under proton. In addition, battery life was not great, the screen's bezels were a little large, and some games needed quite a bit of controller config tweaking to get them nice and playable since not all games have built-in controller support. On that note though Valve has put in tons of work to make controller configurations on the steam deck incredibly powerful and open-ended.
