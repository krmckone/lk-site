This is a short essay on my time so far with the Steam Deck, both LCD and OLED versions.

### Receiving the Steam Deck LCD

I first received my Steam Deck LCD 256GB in July of 2022. I had been waiting for about 4 or 5 months at this point after putting five dollars down to reserve one.

I was excited to get the steam deck for a few reasons. Having most of my steam library available on a handheld would be a huge game change changer, and I'll talk more on that below. In addition, it was just a little linux machine that made it easy to get to the regular linux desktop. It has a separate dock that you can plug your USB devices and monitor into. Even if I'm not one to hack away at linux all day, I think it's really cool that a reliable and easy to use linux device is now so easy get your hands on. On the controls front, the track pads were an improvement over the steam controller's, the back paddles added additional function while letting you keep your thumbs on the track pads or sticks. The LCD screen was just good enough and the later OLED version that we'll get into is a clear improvement. I'll mention this more than once, but I work at the computer for multiple hours at a time during the day. Sometimes the last thing I want to do at the end of a work day is continue to sit at my desk and play PC games. Even though I really enjoy gaming on my desktop with a 7900 XT and 170Hz monitor, one can only ensure so many hours looking at the same screen in the same room in the same chair per day.

### What Kind of Games Work Well

I'll get to some drawbacks in a bit, but there's some solid upsides to playing your games on the steam deck. Games with native linux support work great with no tweaking necessary. Proton also enabled tons of windows-built games to run just fine on steam deck. Some games over time lose proton compatibility through later updates but in general proton is a great bit of software in the linux gaming space. On that front though Valve has put in tons of work to make the software around the controller configuration system powerful and exposes a ridiculous amount of options, particularly for the track pads and joy sticks. When I wanted to try a game without native controller support, I did have to take 10-20 minutes to mess with some options. When playing FPSs, I want to use the right track pad as either mouse or joystick-like-mouse. The sensitivity is important to get comfortable although I still don't have the perfect formula for this. I've been finding that most games are a little different in how they handle mouse input and things may get lost in translation through all of the software layers handling the steam deck input. Regardless, it's pretty easy to get a right track pad configured per game that works well. There's lots of open source plugins as well that you can get for your deck, like one that shows you information from the third party ProtonDB for each of your games. Sometimes user-provided data on ProtonDB is more accurate than Valve's internal testing, so this is useful to have handy. The steam deck's native resolution is 1280*800 at 16:10 so games that natively support this resolution will not cause any black bars around the deck's screen.

### What Kind of Games Do Not Work Well

Games that do not work under proton or do not have a native linux build will probably not work at all on steam deck. Some anti-cheats in particular for multiplayer games have this limitation. Aside from the runtime, really the only other main issues you may run into are performance and controller configuration.

### Things about the LCD that were not my favorite

* It's a little heavy
* Battery life is not great but this also depends on game/settings. This can be tweaked as well in the steam deck triple dot overlay
* The LCD screen is not as good as the OLED version with worse colors/brightness and refresh rate.
* My left track pad was clicky but I think I just had a less-than-ideal quality of build. My guess is Valve's manufacturing process has improved in the lifetime of the LCD

### What about the OLED

I was able to list my dislikes about the LCD because the OLED was able to highlight them for me. I've seen quite a few reviews call the OLED a side-grade of the LCD and say that if you already own an LCD you do not necessarily need to purchase an OLED.

In my opinion the OLED is an upgrade in its own right. For Christmas of 2023 I purchased my wife an OLED steam deck. When it arrived in late November I eagerly opened the package and felt the difference. Stats wise the weight difference between LCD and OLED is not massive however this small difference in weight makes a big difference in prolonged play sessions. My wrists can still fall asleep when playing with poor "wrist/arm" posture, but overall I am very pleased with the perceived decrease in weight on the OLED.

The screen is also a big upgrade in itself. The colors are much nice and I can perceive the difference in brightness settings much better compared to the LCD. I don't known a Switch OLED but I imagine the difference in those units' screens are similar enough.

I find the physical feedback on the track pads much better on the OLED. At the time of writing I'm not sure if they used different track pads for OLED but compared to my old LCD I enjoy using them much better.

Overall I also just like the color scheme better on the OLED. The all-black joysticks are sharp and the subtle orange power button is also sick.
